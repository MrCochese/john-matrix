# JOHN MATRIX

## Scene: Exterior - Jungle Training Facility

Col. Kirby: Now, you'll only have 24 hours to infiltrate Val Varde and depose General Arius. Are you sure your men are up to it, Matrix?

A pair of human eyes appear in the foliage behind Kirby and a huge pair of leaf camouflaged arms grab him. Kirby is startled, and then nods impressed as the hidden commando releases him and steps back into the shadows.

John Matrix: *Laughs* They were trained by me, Colonel. They're the best.

Kirby: After you, of course.

Matrix leads Kirby past various commandos in training, all of whom are wearing the woolen chain-link vest and moustache that are the uniform of Matrix's squad. A huge native american walks past carrying an entire tree trunk on his shoulder.

They arrive at the source of the sound of machinegun fire as a commando finishes firing a tripod mounted gun. We see that he has lopped the tops off a row of flowers.

Kirby: Most impressive.

Matrix is touching a flower petal that has improbably survived the onslaught of bullets, hanging onto its stem by a thread.

Matrix: You can never leave a single enemy standing. Start again.

The commando nods respectfully and begins to feed a fresh bullet chain into the gun.

Matrix: My men omly eat red meat. They are eager to get into battle. Over here is our newest recruit.

Matrix leads Kirby over to several men who are throwing circular saws at target dummies. The youngest of these is Bennett, who has so far only been able to grow a faint pencil moustache.

As they approach Bennett, his throw of the saw glances off the side of the dummy, causing him to cry out in Australian. Matrix encircles Bennett's waist with a massive arm and helps him hold his arm steady for the next throw.

Matrix: You are too restrained, Bennett. You cannot hold back in a battle.

Bennett: Sir. Maybe this would be easier with a real commando weapon, sir.

Bennett throws again, and this time the circular sawblade lodges itself in the dummy's shoulder.

Matrix: A commando's heart is his weapon, Bennett. When you are ready, you will know. (To Kirby) this way, Colonel.

As they move away, Bennett eyes are drawn to the knife on Matrix's belt.

Bennett: I'll be ready, John.
